<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Joseph Joachim Cabrera and I am an aspiring software engineer</p>

<p>Since I was little I was intrigued by the fact how websites and such work and to start my interest, I have dicovered the Inspect option when I right clicked the website. It all started there and now I have a keen interest on developing websites</p>

<p>I am currently in college and looking for a frontend internship-</p>
